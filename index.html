      <p>
  It is a period of civil war. Rebel
  spaceships, striking from a hidden
  base, have won their first victory
  against the evil Galactic Empire.
  During the battle, Rebel spies managed
  to steal secret plans to the Empire's
  ultimate weapon, the Death Star, an
  armored space station with enough
  power to destroy an entire planet.
  Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents,
  Princess Leia races home aboard her
  starship, custodian of the stolen plans
  that can save her people and restore
  freedom to the galaxy....
  you know, it looks like a poem, but it sure as hell don't read like a poem. George Lucas needs to work on his meter, I think.
